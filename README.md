   - Difficulty: Beginner.

2. **Improved Digit Classifier (Project2_ImprovedDigitClassifier)**  
   - Enhance Project 1 with optimization techniques.  
   - Skills: Regularization, Adam optimizer.  
   - Difficulty: Intermediate.

3. **Cats vs. Dogs Classifier (Project3_CatsVsDogsClassifier)**  
   - Use a CNN for image classification.  
   - Skills: Convolutional layers, data augmentation.  
   - Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced.

4. **Sentiment Analysis (Project4_SentimentAnalysis)**  
   - Build an LSTM for IMDB review classification.
