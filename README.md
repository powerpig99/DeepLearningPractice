# DeepLearningPractice

This repository contains a series of projects designed to practice skills from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera, DeepLearning.AI). The projects incrementally increase in difficulty, using PyTorch instead of TensorFlow, and are developed locally with Jupyter Notebook and Cursor editor.

## Projects

1. **Handwritten Digit Classifier (Project1_HandwrittenDigitClassifier)**  
   - **Objective**: Build a basic neural network to classify MNIST digits (0-9).  
   - **Skills**: Neural network basics, forward/backward propagation, PyTorch.  
   - **Difficulty**: Beginner.

2. **Improved Digit Classifier with Optimization (Project2_ImprovedDigitClassifier)**  
   - **Objective**: Enhance Project 1 with regularization and Adam optimization.  
   - **Skills**: Optimization, regularization, hyperparameter tuning.  
   - **Difficulty**: Intermediate.

3. **Cats vs. Dogs Image Classifier (Project3_CatsVsDogsClassifier)**  
   - **Objective**: Use a CNN to classify cat vs. dog images.  
   - **Skills**: Convolutional layers, pooling, data augmentation.  
   - **Difficulty**: Intermediate-Advanced.

4. **Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews (Project4_SentimentAnalysis)**  
   - **Objective**: Build an LSTM model for IMDB review sentiment classification.  
   - **Skills**: RNNs, LSTMs, word embeddings.  
   - **Difficulty**: Advanced.

5. **Music Genre Classification with Transfer Learning (Project5_MusicGenreClassification)**  
   - **Objective**: Classify music genres using a pre-trained CNN and spectrograms.  
   - **Skills**: Transfer learning, project structuring, audio processing.  
   - **Difficulty**: Expert.

## Setup
