Below, I’ve designed a series of projects to help you practice the skills taught in Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization, offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The projects are structured to incrementally increase in difficulty, aligning with the five courses in the specialization: (1) Neural Networks and Deep Learning, (2) Improving Deep Neural Networks, (3) Structuring Machine Learning Projects, (4) Convolutional Neural Networks, and (5) Sequence Models. Each project builds on the previous one, reinforcing key concepts like neural network implementation, optimization, hyperparameter tuning, convolutional operations, and sequence modeling. I’ve tailored these to be practical, beginner-friendly at the start, and progressively more challenging, while ensuring you can use resources like the `amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization` GitHub repo for reference.

**Difficulty**: Easy – foundational skills for a new learner.

#### Objective
Build a neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.

#### Steps
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Load the MNIST dataset (available via `tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist` or download from [Yann LeCun’s site](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)).  
   - Normalize pixel values (0-255) to [0, 1]. Split into training (60,000 images) and test (10,000 images) sets.
2. **Model Design**:  
   - Implement a 2-layer neural network: input layer (784 neurons = 28x28 pixels), hidden layer (10 neurons, ReLU activation), output layer (10 neurons, softmax activation).  
   - Initialize weights and biases randomly.
3. **Training**:  
   - Define forward propagation to compute predictions.  
   - Use cross-entropy loss as the cost function.  
   - Implement backward propagation to compute gradients.  
   - Update parameters with gradient descent (learning rate = 0.01) for 500 iterations.
4. **Evaluation**:  
   - Test accuracy on the test set. Aim for ~85-90% accuracy.
